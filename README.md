# Mission 4

Our (pretend) client this week is Joel Hilton (my brother, who is 2 years, 2 months, and 2 days
younger than myself), and who is also very into movies. So into movies, in fact, that he minored
in Film Studies at BYU, contracts as a movie reviewer for ClearPlay, and does a weekly podcast
with a couple friends about movies called Baconsale.
Joel needs a system to keep track of his ever-expanding movie collection. He only allows
movies he deems worthy into his collection. As his collection grew, he created a spreadsheet to
keep track of all his info. (When I asked him if it was okay if I used his movie collection
spreadsheet as an example for my assignment this week, he wanted to make sure it was
understood to my students that he married into some of these films.)
